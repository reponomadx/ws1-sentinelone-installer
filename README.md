Automated macOS installation and upgrade of SentinelOne using Workspace ONE UEM and Munki.  
This toolset was developed to address cases where standard app deployment methods fail to install or update the SentinelOne agent reliably.

---

## üì¶ What It Does

### `s1_install.sh`
- ‚úÖ Checks if SentinelOne is already installed  
- üìÅ Verifies the PKG exists in the Munki cache  
- üîê Writes a registration token to disk  
- üì• Copies payloads to a local managed user's Downloads folder  
- üöÄ Installs the SentinelOne agent using `installer`  
- üßπ Cleans up all temporary files  

### `s1_upgrade.sh`
- üîç Checks current installed SentinelOne version  
- üîÅ Compares against expected version  
- üì¶ Copies upgrade PKG if out of date  
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Performs in-place upgrade using `sentinelctl upgrade-pkg`  
- üßπ Cleans up staging files  

---

## üß∞ Requirements

To use these scripts successfully in a Workspace ONE environment:

- SentinelOne `.pkg` must be present in Munki‚Äôs local cache  
- A base64-encoded **registration token** must be provided by your SentinelOne console  
- Workspace ONE UEM must inject a secure `password` variable into the script  
- A managed local macOS account must exist with a writable `/Users/username/Downloads` directory  
  ‚Üí Need to elevate that account temporarily? Check out [macOS Elevated Admin Rights with Workspace ONE](https://github.com/reponomadx/macos-elevated-admin-ws1)

---

## üöÄ Deployment Method

1. Add the script(s) to Workspace ONE UEM under **Resources > Scripts**  
2. Use **System context**  
3. Run `s1_install.sh` on devices that need initial deployment  
4. Schedule `s1_upgrade.sh` to run periodically (e.g., every 4 hours)  
5. Add a **Secure String** variable named `password`  
6. Assign the script to your desired Smart Group (e.g., all macOS Workstations)

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Customization

Before deployment, update the following values in the scripts:

```bash
TARGET_USER="Your_macOS_Service_Account"
echo "<Base64_SentinelOne_Token>" > "$TOKEN_FILE"
```

Replace:
- `Your_macOS_Service_Account` with the correct local user account  
- `<Base64_SentinelOne_Token>` with your actual SentinelOne token (in base64 format)

---

## üõë Security Notice

These scripts rely on Workspace ONE‚Äôs secure variable injection for authentication.  
**Do not hardcode credentials or tokens.** Always use UEM variables for secrets.
